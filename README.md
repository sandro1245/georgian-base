# General Description:
Georgian Base is Web app that offers you to look up Georgian Citizens using their firstname and lastname, for information like : birth date, father's name, age , living region, living street, gender from database. 


# Code Description:
Code was not considered to be open-source so it is not easly readable, but i can explain every line if needed for interview

Database was migrated from sqlite to mysql so in code you might see things like joining the tables using numpy instead of sql join(which has very bad performance in sqlite, especially when working with big data like this)



Due to size of the database, it's uploaded externally instead of here, link : https://www.mediafire.com/file/t8wea8wywo1a412/geobase.sql/file
